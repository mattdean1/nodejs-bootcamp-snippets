# nodejs-bootcamp-snippets

I learned Node, Express, and Handlebars over 2-3 days whilst making [a demo app](https://github.com/mattdean1/quake-supply), then went on to run a Node.js bootcamp (a 90 minute webinar) and mentor student developers through the recruitment process at Eli Lilly.

This repo holds the webpage I used during the webinar, with some instructions and code snippets for the candidates to refer to.
